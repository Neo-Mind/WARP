# 2021-08-20 Changes

## Tool Updates
- to be added

## Script Updates
- Shifted `Log` and `OpCodeList` to module files

- Added depth settings to `Log` for hiding unnecessary level of support function logs. All the support functions have been updated.

- Added `getReg` functon to `ModRM` and `SIBase` classes to get their respective member registers quickly.
  It accepts 1 letter as argument ('R' & 'O' for `ModRm` , `I` & `B` for `SIBase`)

- Added `PH_Regs` map to get Placeholder registers quickly based on bit sizes.

- Removed `TAB` constant since it is not needed anymore.


# 2021-07-25 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Added `findAs` function to `Array` types as an extended version of `find`. The function provided as argument can return the result required instead of `true`.
- Forgot to identify `GetInstr` function earlier. Fixed now.


# 2021-07-24 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Corrected 1 bug in `OpData` class.


# 2021-07-22 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Changed the placeholder functions to use `_` & `_.` instead of `?` to avoid clashing with regular wildcards.
- Removed `SwapFiller` & `SetFillTarget` function (kind of redundant with the other one without much benefits).

- Changed the way the byte count is sent to `SwapFillers` and `SetFillTargets`, now the byte count can be clubbed with the index as a string key => `"index, bc"`
- Also, for `SetFillTargets`, the starting address needs to be provided in the map argument itself using the key `start`. If it's not there then `0` is assumed.

- Converted a lot of `let` to `const`
- Changed some of the `forEach` functions to `for of` loops.

- Changed `LOCK`, `REPE` & `REPN` to `ILOCK`, `IREPE` & `IREPN` respectively. The first 3 are now functions instead to automatically prefix these values.
  `REP` function has also been provided as an alias to `REPE`. Check the wiki for more details. 

- Added string instructions to use with the `REP*` functions.


# 2021-07-07 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Added thai language file with translations for the new entries.
- Changed the pattern for 1 byte fillers to use `?.` prefix . The earlier pattern was creating chaos when the bytes are clubbed together.


# 2021-07-06 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Added [Exe.ClearSavedInput](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Exe-Object#patch-related) for clearing existing inputs. Useful in Test Bench.

# 2021-07-05 Changes

## Tool Updates

	- **`POP_EAX`**  = Obvious no?
	- **`CDQ`**
	- **`INT3`**

- Changed [Exe.IsSelected](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Exe-Object#patch-related) function to [Warp.GetPatchState](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Warp-Object#functions) for logical reasons.

- Added 2 functions for displaying messages from patch/extension scripts.
	- **`Warp.InformUser`** = Used for information messages
	- **`Warp.WarnUser`**   = Used for warning messages

- Added switches for **`RegEx`** & **`Case sensitivity`** in all the filter and search inputs.

- Updated **`Dark_Mode`** style for the new entries in UI (for e.g. the filter/search options).
- Updated the templates for [Language](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Language-File) & [Style](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Style-File) files.


# 2021-07-02 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Removed [NO_ALLOC](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Scripted-API#strings--error-messages) constant since it is no longer needed.
- Changed the pattern generated by [Filler](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Scripted-Functions#filler-functions) function for bc = 1. Now it looks like ?01 and ?121 etc.
- Added the reflection options in [Instr](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Instr) class and [CaseAddr](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Scripted-Functions#extractors) function.

- Added [Exe.GetSavedInput](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Exe-Object#user-input) function to retrieve the value of a previously saved user input (either obtained from `session file` or using [Exe.GetUserInput](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Exe-Object#user-input)

- Added support for encrypted scripting. To achieve this, following 3 functions have been added:
	- **`Warp.Encrypt`** = Converts a script code into it's equivalent encrypted bytes. Output is in hex form.
	- **`Warp.Execute`** = Evaluates the provided encrypted hex in the underlying JS engine and return the result.
	- **`Warp.Define`**  = Execute the provided encrypted hex and assign the result to the specified global variable. Returns false if an error occured or if the result was `undefined`.

- Added **`UserChoice`** function as a quick wrapper for yes/no questions to user. Primarily used in extensions.


# 2021-06-30 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Modified Language **`translations`** to check for **`find`** patterns case-insensitively.

	- **`D_VecI8, D_VecI16, D_VecU32`**
	- **`D_VecF`**
	
- All the **`D_Vec`** can have upto `4` elements. The size is determined by the default value provided.
- All of them have individual constraints for setting **`min & max`** values as well as specifying a **`name`**.
  For e.g. `index 1` can be setup as `min1: 3, name1: "X Coord"`. If the `name` is not provided then it defaults to `Index1`
