#    color : red

#    patches:
#        - PatchName1:
#            title : Patch No. 1
#            recommend : yes
#            author : Neo-Mind
#            desc : Just a template to show how to define patches. Still need the function defined though. In this case it is 'PatchName1'
#        
#        - PatchName2:
#            desc : Alright you get the gist. In this one PatchName2 will become the title, it will not be 'recommend'ed and author is 'Unknown'
#
#- GroupName2 #In this one, group's title will be GroupName2, mutex will be true and color will be the default set as per Style.
#
#    patches:
#        -PatchName3: Now even the description becomes empty
#
# ... and so forth
